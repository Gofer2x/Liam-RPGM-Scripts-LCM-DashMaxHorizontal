# Liam's RPGMaker Scripts
This page contains the most up-to-date versions of all of Liam's RPGMaker scripts. Currently all of these scripts are made for RPGMaker VX Ace,
but that may change someday in the future.

## Miscellaneous Notes
The commenting in these scripts will seem excessive to anyone familiar with programming, but the reason for that is that the vast majority of people these scripts
are designed for will not be familiar with programming. These scripts are intended to be commented in a way where even someone who has no knowledge in programming
might be able to make a few tweaks to get the script to work the way they want it to. 

If you would like to talk to me for whatever reason, whether it is to commission a new script, report bugs, or learn RPGMaker scripting yourself, I have a
RPGMaker scripting focused discord server you can join with the following link:

REQUIRES THE "Extra Save Data" SCRIPT! OBTAIN IN #extra-save-data

RPGMaker Ver:           VXAce

Current Version:        1.1.1

Usage License:          Noncommercial/Commercial with attribution (Credit me as "Liam")
                        BUT, note that obviously the original license for the ATS message
                        options still applies, since this is an add-on that requires the original 
                        script.
                        
Description:
This script allows you to designate a number for ATS Message Options text box positions settings (like the n in \et[n]) to mark the text box for the show text command's position as relative to the event that contains the show text command. In other words, it serves as a "this event" marker. Additionally, it also lets you set text box positions as relative to followers, not just the player. In addition, it allows you to automatically set unique talking sounds based off of actorID for the player and any followers they have. Lastly, it simplifies the ATS message options talk sound script calls so you can call sound data by name from a list of sounds you define.
