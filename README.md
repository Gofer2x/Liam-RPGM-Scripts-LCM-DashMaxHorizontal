# Liam's RPGMaker Scripts
This page contains the most up-to-date versions of all of Liam's RPGMaker scripts. Currently all of these scripts are made for RPGMaker VX Ace,
but that may change someday in the future.

## Miscellaneous Notes
The commenting in these scripts will seem excessive to anyone familiar with programming, but the reason for that is that the vast majority of people these scripts
are designed for will not be familiar with programming. These scripts are commented in a way where even someone who has no knowledge in programming might be able to make a few tweaks to get the script to work the way they want it to. 

If you would like to talk to me for whatever reason, whether it is to commission a new script, report bugs, or learn RPGMaker scripting yourself, I have a
RPGMaker scripting focused discord server you can join with the following link:
