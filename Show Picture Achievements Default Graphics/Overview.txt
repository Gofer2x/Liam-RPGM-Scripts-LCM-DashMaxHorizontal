These graphics were created by "the iceman". Please give them credit to them if you use these graphics.
These graphics can be used for noncommercial or commercial projects, so long as credit is given.
The empty black background and achievement title image are exempt from these stipulations as they are not original.

These graphics when put together and assigned the correct names according to the script settings will form
a complete achievements setup.

If you want to see the script working immediately after copy-pasting the initial version of the script into
your script list, then copy paste the contents of the "initial setup graphics" folder into a new folder that you create named
"achievements" in your game's directory. Upon launching your game, you should then be able to access the fully-functioning
achievements screen.

The graphics in the "achievement mockups" folder show how the achievements screen is put together along with roughly how it looks.
